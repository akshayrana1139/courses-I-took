State S is markov iff P ( St+1 | St ) = P(St+1| S1, S2…St).. Future is independent of the past and just relies on previous state

Policy is a map from state to action… or a stochastic one.. P(A=a | S=s)

Value Function is the prediction of future award..




Prediction : Evaluate the future.. given a policy

Control : Optimize the future.. Find the best policy

So we need to predict before we control.
